# Machine Learning Exam: Used Car Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts used car prices based on various features including model, year, mileage, and engine capacity.

## Quick Start

1. **Setup environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the project**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook exam.ipynb
   ```

## Project Files

- `exam.ipynb` - Main analysis and model development
- `cars.xlsx` - Dataset
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `model_weights/` - Trained models
- `plots/` - Generated visualizations
