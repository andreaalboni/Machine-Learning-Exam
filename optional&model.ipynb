    "## Results\n",
    "So, the prediction isn't very good. I see 2 main reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lack of features\n",
    "There are a lot of important features, that are not mentioned in the dataset. The presence of cracks or dents, the general condition of the car interior, the previous number of owners, how long the ad has been on the site, as well as the color of the car. Defects should obviously reduce the cost. Also, a car of a non-standard color may have a lower cost than the classic ones. It can be seen from the diagram that the number of machines for which the algorithm made a big mistake is much larger, as well as the average error is also larger. This means that he often overstates the price than understates. This may indicate just that there are cars with an undervalued value in the sample for one reason or another.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Human factor\n",
    "Due to the fact that the price is set by a person, he may intentionally overstate it or, conversely, underestimate it out of ignorance. Of course, this should not create such a big problem, but it also contributes to the blurring of prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as you can see, with a linear decrease in dimension (PCA), 2 groups were formed within which the data can be conditionally represented as linear. At first I thought that this was due to an underestimation of the price due to external defects, but in this case there should also be a group with inflated prices, and there is no such group. I'm not sure what this means and whether I'm interpreting it correctly. I will be glad to comment"

    "## Reflection\n",
    "The overall prediction power is not good enough. I believe there are several ways to further improve it:\n",
    "\n",
    "More Comprehensive Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering: I noticed that many rows have the same mileage (km), engine capacity (cm3), and even the year but are sold at different prices. I'm not sure if these are input errors or not. Considering this during data cleaning could help in building a better model. Additionally, it would be beneficial to take the brand and model into consideration when building the model. The brand awareness and popularity of a model can significantly influence the price. However, one of the challenges is that the input formats for different brands and models are quite different. This is one reason why I only chose BMW to build the prediction model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning: By utilizing the Optuna module, we can tune the hyperparameters of the XGBoost and LGB models to achieve better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "More Data: I believe the dataset is insufficient to build a reliable model for predicting used car prices. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, the total volume of data is not large enough; we require more training data. Secondly, the information in the dataset may overlook some important factors, such as the color, type, whether it is new/second/third hand, and so on. Moreover, macroeconomic indicators might also influence the demand and price of used cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, there are numerous ways to train a better model, and I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project. If you have any suggestions or comments, please let me know. Thank you! Don't forget to UPVOTE!"
